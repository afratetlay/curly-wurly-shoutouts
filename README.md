### Project Goals

To create a Page for Xigen, this is a Curly Wurly shoutout, for internal and external people to nominate fellow employees for their work. This page allows you to select an employee, write a brief message as to why you are nominating this person and lastly your name. I worked with the backend team for the submission of the form via PHP.
